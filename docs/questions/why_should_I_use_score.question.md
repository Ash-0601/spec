Score does not intend to be a fully featured YAML replacement for platforms, it only aims to define workloads that can be combined with more advanced YAML configurations that an infrastructure team would provide to developers in an organization.

Using Score provides the following advantages:

- The developer only needs to learn the _Score Specification_ to define the workloads that run across various platforms.
- The _Score Specification_ is designed to be applied to multiple environments to reduce the amount of configuration.
- An infrastructure team can help define and configure the resources and multiple platforms where the developer can work on.
