title: "Why would I adopt Score?"
---

Score provides a single, easy to understand specification for each workload that describes its runtime requirements in a declarative manner. The `score.yaml` file allows generating configuration in an automated, standardized and one directional way. By reducing the risk of wrongly specified or inconsistent configuration between environments, we hope to foster focus and joy for developers in their day-to-day work.
