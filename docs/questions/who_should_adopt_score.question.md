Technically, Score can be utilized by any team running containerized applications. When wanting to understand if Score is the right solution for your team, the main thing to orient towards is whether the pain points we communicate resonate with you:

- Are you tired of fighting tech and tools when deploying your workloads from local to production?
- Does making a configuration change feel like a tedious and error-prone procedure?
- Are you often blocked and rely on other (ops) engineers to help you out?

From our experience, bottlenecks typically arise in medium-sized and larger development teams working in a continuously growing production landscape that runs on an orchestrator such as Kubernetes, while dealing with legacy systems, newly introduced tooling, knowledge silos or similar.
